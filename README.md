Hey there <img src="https://github.com/AmitMandliya/AmitMandliya/blob/main/wave.gif" width="20px">

My name is Amit Mandliya and I am a software developer. I am pursuing master's in computer science at North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA. I have a passion for backend development. I have worked in several languages like Java, Python, Julia, Ruby and R. You can find me on [![LinkedIn][1.1]][1], or [![Gmail][1.2]][2]

I have worked as software engineer at Accenture and Infosys for over 3 years. I was a part of enterprise content management team. My role involved creating custom Java application that can interact with [OpenText products](https://www.opentext.com/products-and-solutions/products/customer-experience-management).

Iâ€™m currently contributing to Red Hat's open source subscription management product - [candlepin](https://www.candlepinproject.org/docs/candlepin/overview.html). My role involves migrating the existing dependency injection framework - [Google guice](https://github.com/google/guice) to [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). 
The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/AmitMandliya/candlepin/tree/feature/spring_integration).
